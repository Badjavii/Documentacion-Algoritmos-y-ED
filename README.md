# Algorithms and Data Structures | Personal Documentation

## Purpose of the Repository

This repository is intended to be a collaborative space to share exercises, publish theoretical material, and work with the class plan for the subject of Data Structures in the C++ language. Here you will find useful resources to improve your understanding and skills in this field.

The repository is maintained by [Badjavii](https://github.com/Badjavii) (Administrator and Repository Owner). Our goal is to document our learning process and collaborate in the practice of exercises related to data structures in the C++ language.

## C++ Installation

C++ is a language that does not need to be downloaded and installed, however, it requires a compiler. A compiler is a tool that translates the source code written in a programming language (like C++) to a machine language that the computer can execute. Compilers are essential for converting your programs into executables, allowing the computer's hardware to understand and execute them.

To program in C++, you need to install a compiler. Here we show you some compilers:

- **Visual Studio Code:**
  - **Positive Aspect:** Lightweight and highly customizable.
  - **Negative Aspect:** Requires additional configuration for C++ development.
  - **Installation:** Install the `C/C++` extension from Microsoft and the `C++ Intellisense` extension. In addition, Visual Studio Code has two types of compilers:
    - **MSVC:** Install the compiler from [Visual Studio MSVC](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc#_prerequisites).
    - **MinGW (recommended):** Install the compiler from [Visual Studio MinGW](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites).
- **Code::Blocks:**
  - **Positive Aspect:** Intuitive and easy-to-use interface.
  - **Negative Aspect:** Less extensible compared to other IDEs.
  - **Installation:** Download and install from [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads).
- **Dev-C++:**
  - **Positive Aspect:** Lightweight and quick to install.
  - **Negative Aspect:** Less updated and with fewer advanced features.
  - **Installation:** Download and install from [Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/).
- **Visual Studio:**
  - **Positive Aspect:** Powerful features and intelligent code assistance.
  - **Negative Aspect:** Can be resource-intensive.
  - **Installation:** Download and install Visual Studio 2022 or earlier versions from [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

## Introduction - Algorithms and Data Structures

The subject of Algorithms and Data Structures addresses the dynamic management of memory through structures that use pointers, taking into account complexity and efficiency to optimize memory management and making use of sorting algorithms.

Over the years, concepts of certain data structures have been developed and established that, in the C++ language, must be defined and managed manually through functions. These functions include operations such as insertion, deletion, and data sorting, which we will develop in this course.

The purpose of this approach is to develop an agile ability to propose algorithms that allow the program to read memory addresses effectively (without collapses) and fulfill the task assigned to the structure. This implies efficient memory management and the implementation of dynamic data structures that optimize program performance.

## Recommended Tools for Practice

To improve your skills in algorithms and data structures, we recommend using the following online tools and resources:

- **Tree Applets and Other Structures:**
  - **Use:** Visualize and manipulate different data structures such as trees, graphs, and linked lists.
  - **Importance:** Helps to understand the dynamics and behavior of data structures in real time.
- **[Data Structure Visualizations](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html):**
  - **Use:** Offers a variety of educational resources, including interactive visualizations of algorithms and data structures.
  - **Importance:** Provides a deep and visual understanding of how algorithms and data structures work.
- **[Visualgo](https://visualgo.net):**
  - **Use:** Interactive platform to visualize and learn about algorithms and data structures.
  - **Importance:** Facilitates learning through animations and detailed explanations of each step of the algorithm.
- **[Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer.org):**
  - **Use:** Interactive tool to visualize the execution of algorithms in real time.
  - **Importance:** Allows experimenting with different algorithms and see how they behave with different data sets.
- **[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms):**
  - **Use:** Repository that offers visualizations of various sorting algorithms.
  - **Importance:** Helps to compare the efficiency and operation of different sorting algorithms.
